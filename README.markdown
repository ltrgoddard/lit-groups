# lit-groups

A tool for testing the effectiveness of community detection algorithms in identifying literary groups, using data from *The Oxford Companion to Modern Poetry* (2nd edn). See [Constellations](https://github.com/ltrgoddard/ltrgoddard.github.com/tree/master/constellations) for an interactive visualisation of the same data using D3.js. See the 'conference_version' directory in this project for a version presented at the 2nd Digital Humanities Early Career Conference.
